--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--question 1: How many orders were placed in January?
select count (orderID) from BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

--question 2: How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
select count (orderID) from BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE Product = "iPhone" and length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

--question 3: Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--question 4: Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
where price in (select min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

--question 5:What is the total revenue for each product sold in January. (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
select Product, sum(Quantity)*price as Revenue  
from BIT_DB.JanSales 
group by Product;

--question 6: Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select Product, sum(Quantity), sum(quantity)*price as Revenue
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
group by Product;

--question 7: How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
select count(distinct customers.acctnum) as customers, avg(quantity*price)
from BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
left join BIT_DB.customers customers
on FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id 
where FebSales.quantity > 2 and length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
