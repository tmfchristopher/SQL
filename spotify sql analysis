-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.

--Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--number distinct artists
SELECT count(distinct artist_name)
FROM Spotifydata;

--top 10 artists by popularity
select artist_name, sum(popularity)
from Spotifydata
group by artist_name
order by sum(popularity) desc
limit 10;

--most popular song and artist
select track_name, artist_name, popularity
from spotifydata
order by popularity desc
limit 1;

--stats of top 5 songs
select artist_name, track_name, popularity, danceability, energy, speechiness, acousticness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration_ms/60000 as duration_min
from spotifydata
order by popularity desc
limit 5;

--who has longest song?
select artist_name, track_name, duration_ms/60000 as duration_min
from spotifydata
order by duration_min desc
limit 1;

--average danceability by artist, track
select track_name, artist_name, Avg(danceability)
from spotifydata
group by track_name
order by danceability desc;

--danceability of top 5 popular songs
select track_name, artist_name, popularity, Avg(danceability)
from spotifydata
group by track_name
order by popularity desc
limit 5;

--use a CTE to calculate avg popularity of artists.Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
with popularity_average_CTE as (
select s.artist_name, 
AVG(s.popularity) average_popularity
from Spotifydata s
group by s.artist_name)
select artist_name, average_popularity,
 'Top Star' as tag
from popularity_average_CTE
where average_popularity >= 90
order by average_popularity desc;
